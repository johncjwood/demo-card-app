## Original User Prompt

Look at the code in test-runner.js
There should be no wait times longer than 5 seconds. Please lower any wait times which occur later.

Next, run this code:
node test-runner.js 100 200 300 310 350 360 390 395 400 500

If any fail, then please update the tests or the relevant frontend code so they succeed
