## Original User Prompt

Create 2 new tests, Test 650 and Test 651. It should be a copy of 600 and 601 respectively, except for the dropdown it should choose "Total Unique" from the dropdown with a quantity 10. 651 should observe that this second goal is 50% complete.

This test should not pass, but please update the frontend code to add the value "Total Unique" to the dropdown so that this test can fail gracefully.
